Our code will help stores that have a online website to have inventory of the products the store has and so that 
cutomers can order things online and how many there are in stock for delivery.


# CODE EXAMPLE	

        stringstream geek(prodAvailbe);
		int testVar = 0;
		geek >> testVar;
		if (testVar >= productAvailbe){
		cout << prodName << " are available in this amount: " << prodAvailbe << endl;
	//testVar -= productAvailbe;
							
             {prodAvalible was in the string so we had to convert into a varible}
